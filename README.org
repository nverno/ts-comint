* ts-comint.el (v0.0.1)
Run a TypeScript interpreter in an inferior process window

This repo is directly forked from
[[https://github.com/redguardtoo/js-comint][js-comint]] to support
TypeScript instead.

* Prerequisites

ts-comint depends on the following components:

- NodeJS
- [[https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/typescript-repl][TypeScript REPL]]

To use ts-comint these components must be installed on your system.

To install these run the following commands, or whatever equivalents
your system provides:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get install node
  npm install -g tsun
#+END_SRC

* Installation

Currently only download from Github source is available, but
publishing as a package on MELPA and Marmalade is planned.

To use it in its current from, place the ts-comint.el somewhere say "~/mylisp/".

Insert below code to "~/.emacs.d/init.el",
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/mylisp/")
(require 'ts-comint)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
After installation, do `M-x run-ts` to create a comint buffer with the
Typescript interpreter.

You can add the following couple of lines to your .emacs to take
advantage of cool key bindings for sending things to the Typescript
interpreter inside of typescript-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-x C-e") 'ts-send-last-sexp)
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-M-x") 'ts-send-last-sexp-and-go)
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c b") 'ts-send-buffer)
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b") 'ts-send-buffer-and-go)
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'ts-load-file-and-go)))
#+END_SRC
